# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue occurs despite seemingly correct error handling. The solution involves checking the data structure and potentially adding a check for data length before rendering the FlatList.
